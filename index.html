<h1>HTML</h1>
<P>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the fundamental structure and content for web pages. It uses a system of tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links, forming the basic skeleton of any website. It's a markup language, not a programming language, solely responsible for organizing information.

<h1>CSS</h1>
<P>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the styling language used to control the visual presentation of HTML documents. It dictates colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and responsive behaviors, transforming raw HTML into aesthetically pleasing web designs. CSS ensures a consistent look and feel while separating content from presentation.</P>
<h1>BOOTSTRAP</h1>
<p>Bootstrap is a popular, open-source CSS framework designed for building responsive, mobile-first websites quickly. It provides a vast collection of pre-designed HTML and CSS templates for components like navigation bars, forms, and buttons. Its core feature is a powerful 12-column grid system that simplifies creating layouts adaptable to various screen sizes. Bootstrap significantly accelerates front-end development by offering ready-to-use styles and interactive JavaScript plugins.</p>
<h1>JAVASCRIPT</h1>
<p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It enables features like form validation, animated elements, and asynchronous data fetching from servers, making websites responsive to user actions. Beyond browsers, its versatility extends to server-side development with Node.js.</p>
<h1>NODE.JS</h1>
<p>Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime environment allowing developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, primarily for server-side development. Utilizing a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, it excels at building scalable network applications, APIs, and real-time services. It extends JavaScript's reach to full-stack development.</p>
<h1>REACT</h1>
<p>React is a declarative and efficient JavaScript library specifically designed for building user interfaces (UIs), especially complex single-page applications. It promotes a component-based architecture, enabling developers to construct UIs from reusable, self-contained pieces. React's Virtual DOM optimizes rendering performance, creating highly interactive and dynamic web experiences.p>
